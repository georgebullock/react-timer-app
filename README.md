# REACT TIMER APP

### OVERVIEW
React Timer App is a cancelled projected. The purpose of the project was to practice TDD with React. I cancelled it becauase I was assigned an unplanned, higher-priority, project that consumed the time I made for this project. Also, I achieved my learning goal for this project via the unplanned project. Therefore, I decided to cancel this project and move on.
